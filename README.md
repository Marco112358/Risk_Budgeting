# Risk_Budgeting
 
 This is a risk budgeting model that takes in an 'n' asset portfolio (currently set up for 3 assets)
 inputs needed are asset standard deviations and asset correlation matrix and the risk budget for the n assets
 outputs are the portfolio weights, standard deviation, and pctrs
 This uses a version of Newtons Method to get the weights within a tolerance
